## What is NFT metadata?

Every NFT includes metadata.

Metadata is simply structured information that describes the NFT. In NFTBingo, that metadata defines the card itself.

For a bingo card, this information includes the exact numbers arranged in the 5 × 5 grid and the Series the card belongs to.

## Why metadata matters in bingo

In traditional bingo, verification relies on human checks or physical markers.

In NFTBingo, metadata allows the platform to always know:

- Which numbers belong on a card
- Which spaces should be marked when a number is called
- Whether a card completes a winning pattern
- What payout rate a winner should receive based on what Series their card is from

This removes ambiguity while keeping gameplay fair.

## Fixed numbers, fixed rules

Once an NFTBingo card is minted, its metadata cannot ever not change.

That means:

- The numbers on the card cannot be altered
- Every game uses the same verified card data
- All players are checked using the same logic

This consistency is key to automated verification.

## How games use metadata

During a game:

1. Numbers are drawn one at a time
2. The system compares drawn numbers to each card’s metadata
3. Matching numbers are tracked
4. Winning patterns are detected using predefined rules

Players still play bingo the same way, the system simply assists with checking.

## Transparency and fairness

Because the card’s data is embedded in the NFT, results can always be reviewed and verified on chain.

Metadata allows NFTBingo to combine traditional bingo gameplay with modern digital verification, without introducing complicated mechanics for players.
