Minting an NFTBingo card is designed to be simple, transparent, and fair. Whether you’re new to Web3 or already comfortable using crypto wallets. This post walks through exactly what happens when you mint a Founders Series card and how that card is later used to play NFTBingo.

## Step 1: Visit the Mint Page

To get started, you’ll head to the Mint NFTBingo Cards page on our website. This is the only place where official NFTBingo cards are created.
From there, you’ll be prompted to connect a Solana-compatible wallet. We currently support Solflare, Phantom, and Backpack wallets. This wallet is where your NFTBingo card will be sent once minting is complete.

## Step 2: Connect Your Wallet and Check Your Balance

Before minting, make sure your wallet:
- Is connected to the Solana network
- Contains the required amount of SOL to cover the mint price and network fees
- Nothing is minted until you approve the transaction in your wallet.

## Step 3: Click Mint, Randomization Happens On-Chain

Once you click the Mint button and approve the transaction, the NFTBingo system generates your card. Two important things happen at this moment:

### 🎨 A Background Is Selected
One of 50 unique backgrounds is chosen at random from the NFTBingo background pool. Every card pulls from the same pool, giving all players equal odds and ensuring no background is rarer or more powerful than another.
During the Founders Series Platinum Tier mint, 2 of each background will be chosen.
During the Founders Series Gold Tier mint, 4 of each background will be chosen.
During the Founders Series Silver Tier mint, 4 of each background will be chosen. 
These backgrounds will never be used for any other series of NFTBingo cards.
    
### 🔢 Your Bingo Numbers Are Generated
Next, your card’s bingo numbers are randomly generated following standard bingo rules, from 1-75. These numbers are:
- Placed into a 5×5 bingo grid
- Imprinted directly on the front of your card image
- Permanently recorded in the NFT’s metadata


No two cards are ever the same.

## Step 4: Numbers Are Locked Into the NFT Metadata

This step is critical.
The numbers generated for your card aren’t just visual. They are locked into the metadata of the NFT itself. Once minted:
- The numbers cannot be changed
- The card cannot be altered
- Ownership and data are verifiable on-chain


This is what makes NFTBingo different from traditional bingo cards.

## Why This Matters
NFTBingo cards aren’t just images. They are playable game assets. The minting process ensures that:
- Every card is unique
- Every card follows the same rules
- Every win can be verified using on-chain data


You own your card. The numbers are locked. The game reads the numbers directly from the NFT metadata.

## What’s Coming Next
This minting flow is the foundation for everything else in the NFTBingo ecosystem, including:
- Live bingo games
- Verification of winning cards
- Reuse of cards across multiple games
- Future features like delegating and rentals


In the next post, we’ll break down how NFT metadata is used to verify bingo games and why that matters for fairness and trust.
