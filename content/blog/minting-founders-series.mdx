## How the NFTBingo Founders Series Will Mint (And Why We’re Doing It This Way)

Over the last few weeks, we’ve had a lot of conversations about how NFTBingo should launch its Founders Series. Rather than rushing a mint or trying to force hype too early, we’ve decided to be very intentional and transparent about how this will work.
This post explains what the Founders Series is, how it’s different from regular player cards, and why we’re minting in stages instead of all at once.

## First, where NFTBingo is today

NFTBingo is being built in phases.
Phase 1 – NFTs & Community
This is where we are now. We’re building the NFT infrastructure, card generation, minting flows, and community foundation. All that remains in this phase is community growth and live mint of the first NFTBingo Founders Series cards.
Phase 2 – Token
This phase introduces the NFTBingo token and begins tying cards to on-chain economics.
Phase 3 – Game Ecosystem
This is when the full bingo game system goes live, including automated games and payouts.
Because we are still in Phase 1, it’s important to be clear: the game system is not live yet. That reality directly shapes how and why we are minting the Founders Series.

## Player Cards vs. Founders Series Cards vs. VIP Series Cards

At the launch of our game ecosystem, there will be thee Series of NFTBingo cards.
Player Series Cards
Player Series cards are simple:
They are used to play bingo
They will be publicly minted
They will be priced at $50
They all function the same
If your goal is to play bingo and participate in games once the ecosystem is live, Player Series cards are designed for you.
Founders Series Cards
Founders Series cards are mechanically the same cards as Player Series cards, but with one key difference:
Founders Series cards receive higher payouts once the game ecosystem is live.
There are no special game rules, no exclusive mechanics, and no shortcuts. Founders cards play the same games as Player Series cards, they simply earn more from the same outcomes and have access to special game sessions.
Because of this, Founders cards represent long-term alignment with the protocol and include early access to Alpha/Beta testing as the ecosystem is built, but they are not a shortcut to a finished product today.

##VIP Series Cards

VIP Series cards are the most limited class of NFTBingo cards.
VIP cards are never sold and can never be purchased from NFTBingo.
They are issued only for special occasions, such as:
Community milestones or major events
Strategic partnerships
Contributors and collaborators
Special recognitions or giveaways
Mechanically, VIP cards function the same as other NFTBingo cards, but like Founders cards, they are intended to receive enhanced ecosystem benefits as the platform evolves.
VIP cards exist to recognize meaningful participation and contribution to our project, not financial payments.

##Additional benefits for Founders & VIP Series holders

Beyond higher payouts once the game ecosystem is live, Founders and VIP Series cards also unlock several ecosystem-level benefits that are not available to regular player cards.
These benefits are designed to reward long-term alignment and early support, not short-term speculation.
Token airdrop eligibility (Founders & VIP Series)
Founders Series holders will be eligible for planned token airdrops as the NFTBingo ecosystem progresses.
Rather than a single airdrop far in the future, token distributions are intended to align with major milestones, such as:
Completion of specific Founders mint tiers
Transition between project phases (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3)
Launch of core token mechanics
Importantly, earlier Founders tiers will be eligible for more airdrop events than later tiers.
This means supporters who mint earlier are positioned to benefit from multiple distribution moments, while later participants may only be eligible for a subset of those airdrops.
Exact token amounts, timing, and mechanics will be finalized closer to the Phase 2 token launch, but the intent is clear: early alignment is recognized and rewarded over time.

## The Founders Series mint structure

We’ve set a hard cap of 500 Founders Series cards. That number will never change.
Rather than minting all Founders Series cards at once, releases are tied directly to the NFTBingo roadmap and rolled out in three clearly defined tiers, each aligned with a project phase.

## Platinum Tier – Phase 1 Release

100 Founders Series cards
Released during Phase 1 (NFTs & Community)
Tier 1 represents the earliest Founders release. These cards are intended for supporters who are comfortable aligning with the project at the very beginning of the roadmap, before the token and full game ecosystem exist.
Tier 1 holders participate during the highest-uncertainty stage and are positioned at the very start of the NFTBingo lifecycle, when core infrastructure and systems are being finalized. As a result, Tier 1 Founders are eligible for the widest range of planned airdrops and the earliest Alpha and Beta access as the ecosystem is built.

## Gold Tier – Phase 2 Release

200 Founders Series cards
Released during Phase 2 of the roadmap
This release expands access as the project moves beyond initial NFT and community foundations and into the token phase. At this stage, more of the economic design is visible, and the ecosystem is taking clearer shape.
Tier 2 exists to allow additional long-term supporters to participate as uncertainty decreases and major systems come online.

## Silver Tier – Phase 3 Release

200 Founders Series cards
Released during Phase 3 of the roadmap
This release occurs just before the full game system goes live.
By this point, Alpha testing has concluded and the ecosystem is preparing to transition into Beta testing. Tier 3 Founders are granted Beta access, allowing them to enter the system early, participate in final validation, and be eligible for the final planned airdrop before public launch.
This tier is designed for participants who want exposure to a near-complete, publicly operating system while still capturing the last pre-launch ecosystem incentives.
No additional Founders Series cards will ever be minted beyond this stage.

## Why this approach matters

This structure does a few important things:
Early supporters are rewarded for taking on risk
Later buyers pay for certainty, not promises
Founders supply stays scarce and meaningful
Pricing is transparent and predictable
Most importantly, it avoids the common Web3 mistake of trying to sell future utility before it exists.

## A note on expectations

Founders Series cards are designed to represent early participation and alignment with the NFTBingo ecosystem as it is built.
They are intended to reward community members who want to be involved earlier in the roadmap, participate in testing and feedback, and access ecosystem benefits as they are introduced over time.
Founders Series cards exist for those who want a deeper, longer-term connection to the project and its evolution, alongside enhanced payouts when the ecosystem is fully operational.
Founders Series cards are our way of saying thank you for believing in us and our project as we build it for all to use.
Player Series cards are focused on gameplay and will be the primary way most people participate once the game system is live.

## What’s next

The Platinum Tier will open in Phase 1 and will continue until it is fully minted out.
We’ll announce exact dates, wallet details, and mint instructions separately.
As always, we’d rather move a little slower and do this correctly than rush something we can’t stand behind. That being said, you should expect a date announcement in the very near future.
Thanks for being here at the beginning.
