## Bingo hasn’t changed — the cards have

At its core, NFTBingo is still bingo.

Players use a card with a 5 × 5 grid of numbers. Numbers are called one at a time, and players try to complete a winning pattern. That part of the game stays exactly the same.

What changes is the **card itself**.

## Traditional bingo cards

In traditional bingo, cards are usually:

- Printed on paper
- Purchased for a single session
- Thrown away after use
- Not reusable across games

Once the game ends, the card has no further value.

## NFTBingo cards

NFTBingo cards are digital cards that exist as NFTs.

This means:

- You **own** the card
- You can **reuse it across games**
- The card’s numbers are permanently stored in metadata
- The card can be verified automatically during gameplay

Instead of being a disposable piece of paper, the card becomes a reusable game asset.

## Ownership and verification

Because NFTBingo cards are NFTs, each card has a unique identity and a fixed set of numbers stored in its metadata.

This allows the platform to:

- Verify which numbers belong on each card
- Check winning patterns consistently
- Ensure all players are using valid cards

The gameplay rules do not change, but the **verification process becomes transparent and automated**.

## Familiar gameplay, modern ownership

NFTBingo is designed so that players who already understand bingo do not need to learn new rules.

The experience feels familiar, but the underlying system provides:

- Digital ownership
- Reusable cards
- Automated verification
- Online play without sacrificing fairness

NFTBingo doesn’t reinvent bingo — it modernizes how bingo cards are owned and used.
