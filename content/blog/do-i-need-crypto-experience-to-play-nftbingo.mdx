## Short answer: no

NFTBingo is designed so that players do not need deep crypto knowledge to understand or enjoy the game.

If you understand how bingo works, you already understand most of NFTBingo.

## What players actually need

At a basic level, players need:

- A wallet to hold their NFTBingo cards
- One or more NFTBingo cards
- Access to the game interface

Everything else is handled behind the scenes.

## What NFTBingo handles for you

The platform manages:

- Gas fees
- Card verification
- Number tracking
- Pattern checking
- Game flow

Players are not required to understand blockchain mechanics, smart contracts, or metadata structures.

## Why blockchain is used at all

Blockchain technology is used to:

- Prove ownership of cards
- Ensure cards are unique and verifiable
- Allow cards to be reused across games
- Allows for delegating cards to renters

It supports the system, but it is not the focus of gameplay.

## A familiar experience

NFTBingo aims to feel like a modern online bingo hall, not a technical demo.

The goal is to make gameplay accessible for all while quietly benefiting from digital ownership and verification in the background.
