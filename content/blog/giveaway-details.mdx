## Giveaway Details

We’ve seen some questions about how XP works and how the drawing will be done, so this post walks through the process from start to finish.

## What Is the NFTBingo 1 SOL Giveaway?

One person will win 1 SOL.

Anyone can participate.

You don’t need to buy anything to enter.

The winner will be chosen at random, but people who stay involved will have better odds.

## What XP Means in This Giveaway

XP stands for experience points, but for this giveaway you can think of XP as entries.

Every point of XP you earn counts as one entry in the drawing.

So in simple terms:

1 XP equals 1 entry

If you earn more XP, you have more entries.

If you earn less XP, you still have entries.

Everyone who participates has a chance to win.

## How You Earn XP

XP is earned by completing quests on the Zealy quest board.

Each quest is a small action connected to NFTBingo.

Examples include:

- Joining and staying active in the NFTBingo Discord
- Taking part in community conversations
- Completing giveaway-related quests
- Staying involved as the giveaway runs

Each quest awards a set amount of XP.

As you complete more quests, your XP grows.

## Why Participation Matters

This giveaway isn’t just about giving away SOL.

It’s also about recognizing the people who show up, ask questions, take part in discussions, and help us grow the NFTBingo community over time.

XP gives us a way to reward that involvement while still keeping the final drawing random.

You don’t need to complete every quest to win, but staying active does improve your chances.

## How the Drawing Will Work

When the giveaway ends, here’s what will happen:

We will export the XP leaderboard from Zealy

Each person’s XP will be treated as their entries

We will run a random weighted draw

More XP means more chances, but it does not guarantee a win.

##A Simple Example

Let’s say three people enter:

- Person A earns 10 XP
- Person B earns 50 XP
- Person C earns 100 XP

That means:

- Person A has 10 entries
- Person B has 50 entries
- Person C has 100 entries

All entries go into the same draw.

One entry is picked at random.

Any of them can win, but the person with more XP has a higher chance.

## When the Winner Will Be Drawn

The giveaway drawing will take place during a live broadcast on March 1.

We’ll do the draw live so the community can watch it happen in real time.

## Final Thoughts

XP is simply a way to track participation.

It doesn’t replace randomness, and it doesn’t lock anyone out.

If anything is still unclear, ask in the NFTBingo Discord and someone from the team will help explain.

Thanks for being part of NFTBingo and for celebrating the Founders Series Platinum Tier mint with us.
